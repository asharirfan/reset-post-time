<h1> Reset Post Time </h1>

WordPress plugin to set the seconds of publish/schedule time of post types to zero.

🐛 Every time you schedule a post in WordPress for a specific time, it appears a few seconds late. I came upon this issue while working on a time sensitive website. I was trying to schedule a post to appear at a particular time – not even a second late 🙈

🚀 So, I wrote this lightweight plugin to resolve this issue and I have open sourced it so that anyone else facing the same problem can use the plugin to get rid of this issue 💯
